Number Mirror
1.Write a program that takes a number N as the input, and prints it to the output.
N = input()
print(N)

2.Rearrange Code
You want to input two integers, and output their sum.
Rearrange the code given, so that it does the above task.
c = a + b
a, b = map(int, input().split()) 
print(c)

3.Chef and Instant Noodles
Chef has invented 1-minute Instant Noodles. As the name suggests, each packet takes exactly 1 minute to cook.
Chef's restaurant has X stoves and only 1 packet can be cooked in a single stove at any minute.
How many customers can Chef serve in 𝑌 minutes if each customer orders exactly 1 packet of noodles?
Input Format
The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers 
X and Y — the number of stoves and the number of minutes, respectively.
Output Format
Print a single integer, the maximum number of customers Chef can serve in Y minutes
def max_customers(X, Y):
    return X * Y
if __name__ == "__main__":
    X, Y = map(int, input().split())
    result = max_customers(X, Y)
    print(result)

4.CodeChef Learn Problem Solving
In the new CodeChef Learn module, under the "Learn Problem Solving" section, there are two courses for each language.
For eg. "Python Beginner - Part 1" and "Python Beginner - Part 2". 
These courses help you get started with CodeChef contests.
Currently there are courses for 4 languages, and hence there are 8 courses in this section. But suppose there are courses for N languages, what will be the total number of courses in this section?
Input Format
The only line of input will contain a single integer N, denoting the number of languages for which there are courses.
Output Format
Output on a single line the total number of courses in the section.
def total_courses(N):
    return N * 2
if __name__ == "__main__":
    N = int(input())
    result = total_courses(N)
    print(result)
